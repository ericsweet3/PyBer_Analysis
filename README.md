# PyBer Analysis

## Overview

For this project, I helped PyBer create an overview of the ride-sharing data by various city types. Using Matplotlib and Pandas, I created a summary and a multiple line graph that presented the weekly fares.

- Source - city_data.csv and ride_data.csv
- Matplotlib and Pandas


## PyBer Analysis

- Summary: By the way of looking at both charts, we can see that Urban cities vastly outperform the other city types in terms of number of rides, yet we see that the rides are mostly short and the fares are low per ride. The opposite can be said of the Rural areas, which have the least amount of rides, but they are much longer in terms of distance and the fares are much higher compared to Urban and Suburban
- We see that in late February, mid March, and in April that rides tended to spike at certain points, yet there is no consistent trend that I believe can be attached to this. 

## Analysis Conclusion

Here are the three recommendations that I have for the CEO:
- I believe that we should try and bolster the amount of drivers that we have available for the rural areas. Even though they represent the least amount of rides, they often bring in bigger fares, and there's a solid possibility that giving rural citizens more access to drivers would increase profitability.
- The suburban area should also be looked at more, there's a good opportunity here to increase the amount of drivers for this area and bring in more profits, mostly for the same reason as the urban area.
- Finally, we should keep monitoring the urban area for further changes, and at the moment I have no recommendations for this section since the urban city types are going to typically have more rides than the other two types.
